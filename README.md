Downloading each student assignment on [edmodo](https://www.edmodo.com) can be quite boring especially if you want to save them under each student name on your machine.
Since I didn't see any API solution to get submmited assignment and grade them in a bulk, Iv'e create this python/requests/lxml script.
Hope it can be handy to other teachers also.

Enjoy!
